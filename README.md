Statistics for Business Pacmann - Final Project - The personal loan predictions of customers by performing logistic regression

This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget.

Furthermore, from this dataset, want to know about a customer who will approve a personal loan, from the variables contained in the dataset by doing logistic regression. Where personal loans from this dataset will be seen based on bivariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression to find out what variables are very influential on the approval of personal loans by customers. As well as from the multivariate logistic regression, an evaluation is carried out to find out the best logistic regression model.
